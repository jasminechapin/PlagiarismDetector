User Guide (from our report):
From a user’s perspective on the website, the user should start by uploading 
two folders containing typescript files into the left and right. After uploading 
into the appropriate upload area by clicking the upload area or upload button, the
 user can see all files from the uploaded programs. These files can be previewed by
 clicking on them. The user will click compare. Then, the user will see a pop up displaying 
the number of files not being checked due to those files not being in TypeScript. After
 clicking “Run Plagiarism Tool”, the user will be taken to the next part, showing files in
 program 1 and program 2 that have been uploaded. If no folder has been uploaded in program 1 
or in program 2 and the compare button has been clicked, then it will display an error message
 telling the user to upload a TypeScript project. 

On the next page, the user will be able to see files that have plagiarism. 
Upon clicking on a file, the user can see all of the plagiarism found in 
that file when compared to files from the other program.  Each file has a 
green check or red X indicating if plagiarism was found in that file. If the 
user clicks on a file that has no plagiarism found, a “drawer” will appear on 
the left showing nothing. If a user clicks on a file that has plagiarism found,
 the drawer will appear containing all plagiarism entries found related to the clicked file. 
Then, when the user clicks on the plagiarism file in the drawer, it will display the full code 
from both files, and the offending pieces of code will be highlighted in red in both files.
 The user can then click “Open Plagiarism Entries” button to go back. On the drawer on the left,
 the “View All Files” button brings you back to the overview of program 1 and program 2 files.
 At any time, the user can click the “Start Over” button to restart the entire process and upload
 new programs for plagiarism detection.
